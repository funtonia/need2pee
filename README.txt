Description:
„need2pee“ is an app that shows public toilets next to the user’s location. The several toilets are displayed on a map. They are additionally listed up below and sorted by their distance to the user’s location in a scrollable table.
When the app starts for the first time, the user is asked whether he wants to allow the app to use his location or not. Allowing the location-access is necessary to use the full functionalities of need2pee.
When the user taps on one of the list-items, the corresponding toilet-annotation is highlighted in the middle of the map and the description is shown. Another way to see the details of the toilets is to tap on their annotation-icons. 
By pulling the list downwards it is possible to refresh the distances to the toilets, which is especially important when using the app while walking/driving.
In the filter-option, it is possible to select whether the listed toilets should be barrier-free and/or cost-free. By clicking the „gps“-button, the user gets shown his own location in the middle of the map.
The user has the opportunity to add a toilet at his own location by clicking the „plus“-button. He then gets transferred to a different view and has to enter a unique name (required) and a description. Furthermore, it is possible to select whether the toilet is barrier-free and/or cost-free. In case the user enters too many characters in the textfields, a pop-up feedback appears saying “Maximium xx characters”. 
After adding the own toilet by clicking the “save”-button, it is shown on the map and in the list (only saved locally on the user’s phone). Moreover the user has the opportunity to cancel the adding-process. In this case, he gets back to the start screen with the map. The same happens if he taps the „Back“ button.
Swiping a list-item to the left leads to the option to delete this toilet.
In case the user did not accept the app to use his location he can’t add a toilet at all, can’t see the distances to the different toilets and cannot use the gps-button.
